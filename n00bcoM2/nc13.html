      Nothing to see here. Skipping n00bcon 13 seems
      like a reasonable play. I mean, a lot of things skip number 13. Ship
      decks and hotel floors for two. n00bcon 12 on the other hand, that one will eventually
      happen. I hope. It's probably after 14 though. There's some more info in the Safe Haven.

        <h3>So what's n00bcon then?</h3>
        <p>N00bcon is the World Championship in Oldschool MtG, and the oldest recurring tournament in what is often referred to as "93/94 Magic". This is the 11th annual n00bcon. For more info <a href="../n00bcon11/n00bcon11.html">click this hyperlink</a> for practical info, or check out some previous coverage at <a href="../resources/resources.html">the resources page</a>.
        </p>
        <h3>Seems rad! How do I get an invite?</h3>
        <p>Check out the <a href="../lineup/lineup.html">line-up page</a> to get an overview of which communities still have invites that haven't been handed out yet. If you think that your community has been missed out this year, send an e-mail to the webmaster and we should (probably) be able to set something up for n00bcon 12 when that one comes around. Apart from that, tournament organizers and content creators always have an extra leg up to get special invites when they are allocated. We want this to be a celebration for all the people contributing to the communities.</p>
        <h3>I'm traveling from far, which hotels do you recommend in the area?</h3>
        <p>For the lower-tier spenders, it is possible to get sleeping quarters at the adjacent Gothcon convention. A convention pass from Thursday to Sunday cost around 300 sek (~€30), and access to the sleeping quarters an addition 50 sek (~€5). It is not very confortable nor private, but it works. <br/><br/>
        For most vistiors, e.g. <a href="https://www.nordicchoicehotels.com/quality/quality-hotel-panorama1/">Quality Hotel Panorama</a> is a nice enough hotel just a couple of minutes walk from the site. A few returning players have reported staying at <a href="http://scandic-opalen-gothenburg.gothenburg-hotels.com/en/">Scandic Opalen</a>. There are many other options if you check e.g. AirBNB, TripAdvisor or Hotels.com.<br/><br/>
        For those of you with golden pants, <a href="http://www.goteborg.com/en/upper-house/">Upper House at Gothia Towers</a> is simply awesome. <a href="http://www.dorsia.se/en/">Dorsia</a> and <a href="http://www.avalonhotel.se/en/">Avalon</a> are also great hotels in the high-end part of the spectrum.<br/><br/>
        And don't be afraid to ask the local players if they can help you out with a place to stay! Hospitality is a big part of the 93/94 culture!

        <h3>Rules for deckbuilding?</h3>
        <p>
            Check <a href="../rules/rules.html">this hyperlink!</a>
        </p>
        <h3>Rule enforcement?</h3>
            <p>We play using the current comp rules, nothing added or removed. The rule enforcement level is "Don't be a douche". It is very close to REL-Competative. Notable exceptions from REL-Professional:
                <ul>
                    <li>There are no floor judges. If in doubt about a rule situation, ask your opponent or another player close to you. If you can't figure it out, Head Judge descisions are made by the tournament organizer.</li>
                    <li>Out of order sequencings are usually OK. Nobody should try to "get you" if you e.g. activate Mishra's Factory in beginning of combat.</li>
                    <li>Unsportsmanlike conduct and "Power Gaming" are highly discouraged.</li>
                </ul>
        <h3>Reprints and alters?</h3>
        <p>Artist alterations of cards in legal sets are ok as long as you can read the full name of the card and its mana cost. Just make sure that your opponent knows what cards you are playing. The three first printings of The Gathering are legal; 1st Edition "Alpha", 1st Edition "Beta", and 2nd Edition "Unlimited".
        Due to popular demand, the 1994 summer printings of The Gathering 3rd Edition distributed in Ireland and Tenesse (populary known as "Summer Magic" or "Edgar") are also legal.<br/> <br/>
        The decks cannot contain "proxie cards" of any sort.
        </p>
        <h3>Will you make playmats or something?</h3>
            <p>Playmats are unlikely (we did that for n00bcon 9 already), but "something" is likely :) We may set up a "make your own playmat"-workshop if there is an interest though.</p>
        <h3>Will there be opportunities for on-site trading, or an on-site store?</h3>
        <p>Of course! Trading tables will be set up, and we'll have a store at hand as well. Unfortunatly this is only open to the participants. If we could let in more people in the pub, we would invite more players ;)</p>
        <h3>Refreshments?</h3>
            <p>Rotary pub has a solid selection of beer from around the world, as well as pub food such as pizza and bugers for very reasonable prices. As the pub have a liquor licence and the rules that come with it, bringing your own alcohol to the pub is not allowed.</p>
        <h3>Coverage?</h3>
            <p>Live video coverage will be provided, with comments provided by Magnus "Mg" de Laval and Gordon "Gordon Anderson" Anderson. It will presumably be streamed on the oldschoolMtg channel at twitch. More info will come!</p>
        <h3>Something else?</h3>
            <p>If you have any further comments or feedback, please contact our administrator using the @-sign below!</p>

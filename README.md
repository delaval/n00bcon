# n00bcon
Various files for the n00bcon webpage(s). Index.html in root is simply current n00bcon.com. Folders contain older webpages.
A few notes / apologies:

 * A lot of stuff, mainly images and css, are duplicated for each year, as this was originally separate projects. This could be a cleanup job ;)
 * Some folder structures are very convoluted, and some pages are coded wierd. There is apparent duplication some places. These things are partly due to make the easter eggs on the page harder to find.
 * A few javascript files have been run through an obscurifier to make them bordeline impossible to read. Again, this is to make the easter eggs harder to find. If you want to know more, feel free to ping me ;)
 * I never thought other people would like to read this, so I haven't gone overboard with the comments ;) Everything is written in notepad though, so it should hopefully be reasonably readable for any web 1.0 enthusiasts.

        <h3>I'm traveling from far, which hotels do you recommend in the area?</h3>
        <p>For the lower-tier spenders, it is possible to get sleeping quarters at the adjacent Gothcon convention (<a href="http://www.gothcon.se/xli">click here for info about Gothcon 41</a>). A convention pass from Thursday to Sunday cost 300 sek (~€30), and access to the sleeping quarters an addition 50 sek (~€5). It is not very confortable nor private, but it works. <br/><br/>
        For most vistiors, e.g. <a href="https://www.nordicchoicehotels.com/quality/quality-hotel-panorama1/">Quality Hotel Panorama</a> is a nice enough hotel just a couple of minutes walk from the site. A few returning players have reported staying at <a href="http://scandic-opalen-gothenburg.gothenburg-hotels.com/en/">Scandic Opalen</a>. There are many other options if you check e.g. AirBNB, TripAdvisor or Hotels.com.<br/><br/>
        For those of you with golden pants, <a href="http://www.goteborg.com/en/upper-house/">Upper House at Gothia Towers</a> is simply awesome. <a href="http://www.dorsia.se/en/">Dorsia</a> and <a href="http://www.avalonhotel.se/en/">Avalon</a> are also great hotels in the high-end part of the spectrum.
        </p>
        <h3>How do one get an invite?</h3>
        <p>Check out the <a href="../lineup/lineup.html">Line-up page</a> to get an overview of which communities still have invites that haven't been handed out yet. If you think that your community has been missed out this year, send an e-mail to the webmaster and we should (probably) be able to set something up for n00bcon 11 when that one comes around. Apart from that, tournament organizers and content creators always have an extra leg up to get special invites when they are allocated. We want this to be a celebration for all the people contributing to the communities.</p>
        <h3>Playmats?</h3>
            <p>In the early days, Khalsa-Brain provided exclusive playmats for the Magic world championship. We figured that if we should have playmats here, they should be made in that spirit. We did make a few sweet playmats last year at n00bcon 9, but it is at point still uncertain if we will make mats for n00bcon X. Please voice your opinions in the guestbook below. Everybody competing in the Wizard's Tournament event Thursday will however get an utterly basic (and old school) playmat along with some beads for life counting.</p>
        <h3>Rule enforcement?</h3>
            <p>We play using the current comp rules, nothing added or removed. The rule enforcement level is "Don't be a douche". It is very close to REL-Competative. Notable exceptions from REL-Professional:
                <ul>
                    <li>There are no floor judges. If in doubt about a rule situation, ask your opponent or another player close to you. If you can't figure it out, Head Judge descisions are made by the tournament organizer.</li>
                    <li>Out of order sequencings are usually OK. Nobody should try to "get you" if you e.g. activate Mishra's Factory in beginning of combat.</li>
                    <li>Unsportsmanlike conduct and "Power Gaming" are highly discouraged.</li>
                </ul>
        <h3>Reprints and alters?</h3>
        <p>Artist alterations of cards in legal sets are ok as long as you can read the full name of the card and its mana cost. Just make sure that your opponent knows what cards you are playing. The three first printings of The Gathering are legal; 1st Edition "Alpha", 1st Edition "Beta", and 2nd Edition "Unlimited".
        Due to popular demand, the 1994 summer printings of The Gathering 3rd Edition distributed in Ireland and Tenesse (populary known as "Summer Magic" or "Edgar") are also legal.<br/> <br/>
        The decks cannot contain "proxie cards" of any sort.
        </p>
        <h3>Will there be opportunities for on-site trading, or an on-site store?</h3>
            <p>Of course! Trading tables will be set up, and we'll have a store at hand as well. Unfortunatly this is only open to the partiipants. If we could let in more people in the pub, we would invite more players ;)</p>
        <h3>Refreshments?</h3>
            <p>Rotary pub has a solid selection of beer from around the world, as well as pub food such as pizza and bugers for very reasonable prices. As the pub have a liquor licence and the rules that come with it, bringing your own alchol to the pub is not allowed.</p>
        <h3>Coverage?</h3>
            <p>Live video coverage will be provided, with comments provided by Magnus "Mg" de Laval along with an expert commentator. It will presumably be streamed on the oldschoolMtg channel at twitch. More info will come!</p>

    <h3>Is this the way out of the maze?</h3>
    <p>Yes.</p>

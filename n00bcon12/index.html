Heya.
Alexander, DFB, Lorenzo, BjÃ¶rn, Hardy, Bob, Florian, Elias, Constantine and
Adam. I expected to see you guys here. Perhaps a few more as well, but you ten
have previously cracked my riddles and hold a special place around these parts. I
had planned a truly insane challenge for you guys this year, a long con of some
proportion. But a few technical issues along with a different way to handle the
invites made it hard to finish. And then the whole pandemic thingie made
finishing the n00bcon 12 riddle a bit uninspired. There was no n00bcon 12 in 2020
after all. But as you guys are here, let me tell you what was planned, and
apologize for not having a proper challenge for you for n00bcon 12.

As you guys might remember, last year the riddlemaster was Illusionary Mask,
and the year before that we had Chaos Orb. This time it was supposed to be
Vesuvan Doppelganger that pulled the reins. The full site would be set up in a
an A/B testing kinda way, with 80% of the traffic going to pages that were in
fact "Doppelganger pages" and 20% going to "real pages". Reloading a page would
have you roll the die again and perhaps hit a real page. The doppelganger pages
would look exactly the same at glance, but have different secrets and clues
than the other pages. The only thing that would make you sure that you were on
a real page would be the creature card gifs; while browsing pictureless the
alt-text would be blue rather than black. On the "Doppelganger pages" all hints
and secrets would be red herrings, and true clues would only be found on real
pages. The goal would be to unlock which five creatures the doppelganger had
cloned, do some transformation on their names, and then use the output as a
key. While the clues were all available at the page, to find the actual
creatures you'd have to venture far out of the site's boundaries. Some clues
had technical difficulties though, one in particular - "Last Easter, I murdered
a man and then changed clothes to my final form" - hinted to find an exchange
about Vesuvan Doppelganger from a discussion I had with Jason Schwartz about
his Royal Assassin collection on last year's n00bcon stream, but that part of
the stream was unfortunately lost, so the clues for the fifth form had to
change. One other form, the first form, may have been noticed by eagle-eyed
readers of The Prodigal Sorcerer from Wizard's Tournament 2, where Vesuvan
Doppelganger is replaced by a different card in the checklist. Hey, thinking of
it, you might be able to solve this one: "In Summer Time I was to change to my
third form, but my mana was drained." If you can solve that one, consider
yourself having solved whatever excuse for a riddle we had this year ;)

Again, I'm sorry that I haven't fully managed to keep up the tradition of
escalating our pre-Easter Easter egg hunt here. I hope this short text is
something to find behind the scenes here at least, and that you know that this
story is for you guys. And I'll be sure to spot a beer to whomever finds out
the third form first.

All the best,
Mg

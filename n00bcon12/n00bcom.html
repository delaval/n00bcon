    </center>
            <p>
              When n00bcon had to be cancelled due to the pandemic, wise mages devised a way to hold a distributed cyberspace tournament using <i>Internet</i>-based video calls. Rather than meeting up in person, wizards at n00bcoM calls in to the tournament from their homes using protocols like <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc768">UDP</a>. Moving the territory to cyberspace makes this gathering immune to the constraints of the physical world, and as such no invite qualifier is needed. If you have a deck, a modem, and a phone line, you are welcome to sign up. If you still have any questions after consulting the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ), feel free to contact the webmaster via <i>e-mail</i> at <a href="mailto:delaval@gmail.com">delaval@gmail.com</a>.

                <b>What</b>: n00bcoM, a pandemic friendly alternative to the traditional n00bcon gathering.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                <b>When</b>: Good Friday the 10th of April, starting at 14:00 CEST. Seven gruelling rounds of swiss followed by a top8. Rounds in the swiss are 50 minutes (swiss matches not reported within an hour will be considered drawn). The top8 is un-timed, but expected to be played at a reasonable pace.

                1, Tap: Choose a nontoken permanent on the battlefield. If Chaos Orb is on the battlefield, flip Chaos Orb onto the battlefield from a height of at least one foot. If Chaos Orb turns over completely at least once during the flip, and touches the chosen permanent, destroy that permanent. Then destroy Chaos Orb.

             <img src="img2/river_boa.gif" alt="River Boa" width="100">
            <h3>How does one play over the <i>Internet</i>?</h3>
            <p>The same way you would in person. Make sure that your video and sound devices are able to transfer data via the recommended <i>Internet</i>-protocols before the tournament starts. Before each match, talk a bit with your opponent and ask them how they want you to cut your deck. Try to set up your video camera in a way that it shows your entire territory (plus library, hand, and graveyard) without too much glare. If you want to learn more about <i>Internet</i>, click <a href="../help.html">this link</a> for web surfing basics, or the links at the top of this page for some relevant RFCs (Request For Comment).
            </p>
            <h3>Rule enforcement?</h3>
                <p>The rule enforcement level is "Don't be a douche". It is very close to REL-Competative. Notable exceptions from REL-Professional:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>There are no floor judges. If in doubt about a rule situation, ask your opponent. If you can't figure it out, Head Judge descisions are made by the tournament organizer.</li>
                        <li>Out of order sequencings are usually OK. Nobody should try to "get you" if you e.g. activate Mishra's Factory in beginning of combat.</li>
                        <li>Unsportsmanlike conduct and "Power Gaming" are highly discouraged.</li>
                    </ul>
            <h3>Reprints and alters?</h3>
            <p>Artist alterations of cards in legal sets are ok as long as you can read the full name of the card and its mana cost. Just make sure that your opponent knows what cards you are playing. Reprints are <i>legal</i> for this particular tournament (in accordance to the information under <a href="#Rules">Rules</a>).<br/> <br/>
            The decks cannot contain "proxie cards" of any sort. This includes checklist cards (e.g. Collector's Edition), and home-made proxies (e.g. "Re-Backs").

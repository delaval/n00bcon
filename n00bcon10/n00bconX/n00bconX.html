            <b>What</b>: The 10th annual n00bcon, aka The World Championship in Oldschool Magic. It's the place to show that you have what it used to take to be a master at Magic, but mostly to drink craft beer, look at amazing decks, and enjoy the fun side of magic tournaments. 
            <br />
            <br />
            <b>When</b>: Good Friday the 30th of March, starting at 14:00. Seven gruelling rounds of swiss followed by a top8. Rounds in the swiss are 60 minutes, the top8 is un-timed, but expected to be played at a reasonable pace.
            <br />
            <br />
            <b>Where</b>: Rotary Pub at Richertsgatan 2, Gothenburg, Sweden. <br/>
            <img src="../img2/mapRotary.png" alt="Rotary map"/>
            <br/>
            You can check out some more info about the site at the <a href="http://rotarypub.se/">Rotary Pub home page</a> 
            <br/>
            <br/>
            Gothcon (Sweden's oldest gaming convention) will be held in Gothenburg at the same weekend. The Gothcon site is about 8 minutes walk from the n00bcon site. The Magic schedule for Gothcon will be hyperlinked here as soon as it is published. There will also be <a href="../wizardstournament.txt">a tournament in Magic as it was first released</a> during the thursday before the championship tournament (i.e. March 29). There will most certainly be another casuals 93/94 tournament during the Saturday as well for those interested.
            <br />
            <br />
            <b>Participation</b>: There's an upper limit of 100 players at the event due to regulations in the pub. Though we did managed to stretch that slightly, due to high demand n00bcon is an invite-only tournament. The players who have a spot confirmed, as well as the community profiles that still have spots to hand out, can be seen on the <a href="/lineup/lineup.html">Line-up</a> page.
            <br />
            <br />
            The entry fee for the tournament is 200 sek (around â‚¬20). This fee is for covering expenses at the tournament such as location, personell, additional tables/chairs, thropies, pins, and a few Easter Eggs. If any money are left over after the tournament, it will be given to charity.
            <br />
            <br />
            People who aren't participating in the tournament or work at the pub are unfortunately not allowed at the site. This is due to mainly three reasons:
        </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Fire code. The pub does not allow more people than already signed up</li>
                <li>Alchol regulations. This gathering is considered to be "closed company". I.e. we need to have a guest list of the people who will attend in order to serve alcohol the way it's done at the tournament.</li>
                <li>Safety. Participants have pushed for the "only-players" policy due to concerns about the high number of rare cards at the event</li>
            </ul>
        <p>
            If you just want to watch, feature matches from the tournament will be streamed live. If you want to trade cards with someone not participating in the event, I reccomend that you set up a meeting at e.g. the Gothcon site.
            <br />
            <br />
            <b>Prizes</b>: The winner get a Giant Shark (The Dark). Top8 gets some sort of trophies. Some secret prices in Easter Eggs will be handed out as well. Of course everyone gets a rad convention pin.
